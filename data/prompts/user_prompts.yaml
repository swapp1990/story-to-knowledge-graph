GRAPH_RELATIONSHIP_EXTRACTOR: |
  Schema:
  {schema_json}

  Existing Nodes:
  {nodes_list}

  Text to analyze:
  {text}

  Extract relationships between the provided nodes based on the schema. Only extract relationships that are explicitly mentioned in the text between existing nodes. 

  IMPORTANT:
  1. ONLY use relationship types defined in the schema (Eg. LOCATED_AT, KNOWS, POSSESSES, PART_OF)
  2. Map similar relationships to these schema types:
     - Eg. Any character interaction -> KNOWS
  3. Ensure all required properties are included:
     - Eg. LOCATED_AT requires "since"
  4. Add optional properties when available in the text
  5. Ensure source and target node types match schema requirements
